# Auxiliary Space Complexity

**Auxiliary space complexity** refers to the **extra memory space used by an algorithm**, **excluding the space needed to store the input data.**

It measures only the **additional memory required** for variables, data structures, and function call stacks **that the algorithm creates during execution**. For example:

- An algorithm that sorts an array in-place has O(1) auxiliary space
- An algorithm that creates a copy of the input array has O(n) auxiliary space

## Important Notes

- we don't count the space needed to store the input data
