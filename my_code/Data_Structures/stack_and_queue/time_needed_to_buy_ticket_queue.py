#  Problem Description (Simplified):

# There are people standing in a line to buy tickets.

# Each person can only buy 1 ticket per turn.

# If someone needs more tickets, they go to the end of the line after buying one.

# Once they buy all their tickets, they leave the line.

# You're given an array tickets[] â€” where tickets[i] is how many tickets person i wants.

# Return the total time it takes for the person at position k to finish buying all their tickets.

# NOTE: Each ticket takes 1 second to buy.
